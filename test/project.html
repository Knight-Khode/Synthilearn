                        A company called Glowing Plant has used synthetic biology to create plants that can glow in the dark. The plants contain a gene from fireflies that allows them to produce their own light, making them potentially useful for everything from streetlights to decorative lighting.
                        Glowing Plant's bioluminescent trees could potentially have many uses beyond just decoration or lighting. For example, they could be used in urban areas where streetlights are difficult or expensive to install, or in remote areas where access to electricity is limited. Additionally, the technology used to create these trees could potentially be applied to other plants to make them more resilient or productive.

                        Insulin is a hormone that is used to treat diabetes, but it can be difficult and expensive to produce in large quantities. Using synthetic biology, researchers have created genetically modified bacteria that can produce human insulin in large quantities, making it more affordable and accessible.
                        raditional methods of producing insulin involve extracting it from the pancreas of animals such as cows or pigs, which can be expensive and can lead to shortages. By using synthetic biology to create insulin, researchers have found a way to produce it more efficiently and with fewer resources. This could make insulin more affordable and accessible to people with diabetes around the world.

                    <p style="text-decoration:justify; line-height:1.6;">
                        Traditional plastics can take hundreds of years to decompose, causing significant environmental damage. Scientists have used synthetic biology to create biodegradable plastics that can break down more quickly and safely in the environment.
                        The development of biodegradable plastics is an important step towards reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste. By using synthetic biology to engineer bacteria that can break down plastics more quickly, researchers have created a potential solution to one of the biggest environmental challenges of our time.

                    <p style="text-decoration:justify; line-height:1.6;">
                        Researchers have engineered bacteria that can target and destroy cancer cells in the body. These bacteria are designed to only activate in the presence of cancer cells, making them a potentially effective and precise treatment for cancer.
                        The use of bacteria to target cancer cells is an exciting new approach to cancer treatment. Unlike traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, which can damage healthy cells as well as cancer cells, bacteria that have been engineered to only activate in the presence of cancer cells could potentially be a more precise and effective treatment.
